Welcome to the CGIsandbox local testing server.

Using this python script you can launch a local server that permits you to test 
your cgi scripts without needing an actual server.

Now that the server is running, you can feel free to navigate the CGIsandbox
files using the address bar rather than the needing to use the terminal.

Press enter in the terminal when you want to quit the server, though this
is not necessary in order to see changes within your files, simply use refresh
for that.



For future use, refer to the following:

'python CGITest.py directory condition assignmentId workerId' will permit you
to set the various fields when the browser is called.
All fields are optional, but must be in that order as of Nov 6 2012

HIT ENTER (IN THE TERMINAL) TO SHUTDOWN THE SERVER
